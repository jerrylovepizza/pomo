#### What is Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study.

Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. - Wikipedia
